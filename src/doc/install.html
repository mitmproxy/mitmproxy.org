## Installing from source

The preferred way to install mitmproxy - whether you're installing the latest
release or from source - is to use [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/). If you
don't already have pip on your system, you can find installation instructions
[here](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html).

<pre class="terminal">
pip install mitmproxy
</pre>

If you also want to install the optional packages AMF, protobuf and CSS
content views, do this:

<pre class="terminal">
pip install "mitmproxy[contentviews]"
</pre>


## OSX

The easiest way to get up and running on OSX is to download the pre-built
binary packages from [mitmproxy.org](http://mitmproxy.org). If you still want
to install using pip, there are a few things to keep in mind:

- If you're running a Python interpreter installed with homebrew (or similar),
you may have to install some dependencies by hand. 
- Make sure that XCode is installed from the App Store, and that the
command-line tools have been downloaded (XCode/Preferences/Downloads).

There are a few bits of customization you might want to do to make mitmproxy
comfortable to use on OSX. The default color scheme is optimized for a dark
background terminal, but you can select a palette for a light terminal
background with the --palette option. You can use the OSX <b>open</b> program
to create a simple and effective <b>~/.mailcap</b> file to view request and
response bodies:

<pre class="terminal">
application/*; /usr/bin/open -Wn %s
audio/*; /usr/bin/open -Wn %s
image/*; /usr/bin/open -Wn %s
video/*; /usr/bin/open -Wn %s
</pre>


## Ubuntu

On Ubuntu, you will need the following native packages to install mitmproxy
from source:

- build-essential
- python-dev
- libffi-dev
- libssl-dev
- libxml2-dev
- libxslt1-dev
- zlib1g-dev
